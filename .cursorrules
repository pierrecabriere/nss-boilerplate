This project is a modern full-stack boilerplate utilizing Next.js 15, Supabase, Shadcn/UI, and more.
It follows a well-organized structure with Next.js App Router pages in src/app/, component definitions under src/components/, and utility configurations in src/lib/.
You can review the reusable UI components from shadcn/ui in src/components/ui and explore the database functionality in src/lib/supabase. Additionally, database schema types can be found in src/types/database.ts. This file is automatically generated by Supabase so you should not edit it. Component stories are located in src/stories/ directory and can be viewed using Storybook. For further guidance on authentication, internationalization, and customization, please refer to the project's README and the code comments.
